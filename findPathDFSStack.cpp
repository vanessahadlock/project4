/* Public member function of maze called findPathDFSStack() that takes in the starting vertice
 * and the goal vertice using depth first search iteratively with a stack. The algorithm creates
 * a stack of the nodes and an array of the visited nodes to keep track. It then inserts the start
 * node into the stakck and runs the while node s is not equal to the goal node. The element from
 * the stack is oppped and printed if it has not been visited yet. A for loop runs to mark every
 * adjacent and unvisited node of the current nodes and insert it into the stack.
 * @param       int start, int goal - the starting and ending vertices of the maze
 * @return      none
